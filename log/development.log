But this being a cocktail bar, you're really here for the outstanding list of spirits and drinks made with them.

It‚Äôs one of the best and most well-stocked and tiered bars we‚Äôve seen for a while. The initially overwhelming list of almost 800 whiskies (featuring everything from Talisker 10-year-old to Glenfiddich 12-year-old) can be deciphered by the helpful staff.\n\nThe menu isn't limited to whisky, though. It also includes all the usual spirits and cocktails; and large beer and wine lists.

One of the first small bars, Pocket soon proved a hit. A couple of years later and the Pocket crew was eyeing expansion. Stitch opened in early 2011.\n\nFrom the initial idea of adorning the walls with old Singer sewing machines, they decided to go all out with the theme. Sewing machines and spools of thread mark the bar's street entrance. Downstairs, there‚Äôs a wall of booths, tables set against the staircase and vintage lamps throwing murky light.\n\nThe bar's cocktail menu changes frequently, offering riffs on classics plus more off-beat concoctions. A sizeable whisky selection is kept behind the bar, some of which is barrel-aged for use in Old Fashioneds and Manhattans.
