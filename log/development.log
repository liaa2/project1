But this being a cocktail bar, you're really here for the outstanding list of spirits and drinks made with them.

It‚Äôs one of the best and most well-stocked and tiered bars we‚Äôve seen for a while. The initially overwhelming list of almost 800 whiskies (featuring everything from Talisker 10-year-old to Glenfiddich 12-year-old) can be deciphered by the helpful staff.\n\nThe menu isn't limited to whisky, though. It also includes all the usual spirits and cocktails; and large beer and wine lists.

One of the first small bars, Pocket soon proved a hit. A couple of years later and the Pocket crew was eyeing expansion. Stitch opened in early 2011.\n\nFrom the initial idea of adorning the walls with old Singer sewing machines, they decided to go all out with the theme. Sewing machines and spools of thread mark the bar's street entrance. Downstairs, there‚Äôs a wall of booths, tables set against the staircase and vintage lamps throwing murky light.\n\nThe bar's cocktail menu changes frequently, offering riffs on classics plus more off-beat concoctions. A sizeable whisky selection is kept behind the bar, some of which is barrel-aged for use in Old Fashioneds and Manhattans.

Tables and chairs sit atop concrete floors and tea light candles flicker through the murky light. There's an outdoor area out back. It's a pleasant spot, made so by dangling plants and funky old stools. And if the laneway looks familiar, that's because it's also home to The Baxter Inn.\n\nTo drink, there's a good list of Australian beers and a wine list that's heavy on bottles from South Oz and France. But this being a cocktail bar, you're really here for the outstanding list of spirits and drinks made with them. Gin is a real passion and there are more than 300 to choose from, plus respectable ranges of whisky, rum, tequila and mezcal. They're paired with intriguing ingredients such as basil distillate (i.e. a spirit made from basil); almond oil and snowpea tincture."], ["phone", "(02) 9299 9699"], ["created_at", "2018-05-18 08:27:48.798388"], ["updated_at", "2018-05-18 08:27:48.798388"]]

Tables and chairs sit atop concrete floors and tea light candles flicker through the murky light. There's an outdoor area out back. It's a pleasant spot, made so by dangling plants and funky old stools. And if the laneway looks familiar, that's because it's also home to The Baxter Inn.\n\nTo drink, there's a good list of Australian beers and a wine list that's heavy on bottles from South Oz and France. But this being a cocktail bar, you're really here for the outstanding list of spirits and drinks made with them. Gin is a real passion and there are more than 300 to choose from, plus respectable ranges of whisky, rum, tequila and mezcal. They're paired with intriguing ingredients such as basil distillate (i.e. a spirit made from basil); almond oil and snowpea tincture."], ["phone", "(02) 9299 9699"], ["created_at", "2018-05-18 09:09:49.117318"], ["updated_at", "2018-05-18 09:09:49.117318"]]

A spiral staircase leads to the mezzanine, where a dumb waiter elevates drinks from the bar, and tealight candles flicker against the dark. Outside, picnic tables sit on AstroTurf below a wall of faux ivy studded with fairy lights.\n\nAt the bar, house-made syrups, bitters and tinctures are used to create classic cocktails and a revolving, seasonal list.

It‚Äôs one of the best and most well-stocked and tiered bars we‚Äôve seen for a while. The initially overwhelming list of almost 800 whiskies (featuring everything from Talisker 10-year-old to Glenfiddich 12-year-old) can be deciphered by the helpful staff.\n\nThe menu isn't limited to whisky, though. It also includes all the usual spirits and cocktails; and large beer and wine lists.

One of the first small bars, Pocket soon proved a hit. A couple of years later and the Pocket crew was eyeing expansion. Stitch opened in early 2011.From the initial idea of adorning the walls with old Singer sewing machines, they decided to go all out with the theme. Sewing machines and spools of thread mark the bar's street entrance. Downstairs, there‚Äôs a wall of booths, tables set against the staircase and vintage lamps throwing murky light.The bar's cocktail menu changes frequently, offering riffs on classics plus more off-beat concoctions. A sizeable whisky selection is kept behind the bar, some of which is barrel-aged for use in Old Fashioneds and Manhattans. Beer and cider, and a wine list heavy on local drops completes the drinks menu.", "phone"=>"(02) 9279 0380", "website"=>"http://www.houseofpocket.com.au/bars/stitch-bar-sydney-cbd/venue-details/"}, "commit"=>"Update Bar", "id"=>"188"}

Tables and chairs sit atop concrete floors and tea light candles flicker through the murky light. There's an outdoor area out back. It's a pleasant spot, made so by dangling plants and funky old stools. And if the laneway looks familiar, that's because it's also home to The Baxter Inn.To drink, there's a good list of Australian beers and a wine list that's heavy on bottles from South Oz and France. But this being a cocktail bar, you're really here for the outstanding list of spirits and drinks made with them. Gin is a real passion and there are more than 300 to choose from, plus respectable ranges of whisky, rum, tequila and mezcal. They're paired with intriguing ingredients such as basil distillate (i.e. a spirit made from basil); almond oil and snowpea tincture.", "phone"=>"(02) 9299 9699", "website"=>"http://thisisthebarbershop.com/"}, "commit"=>"Update Bar", "id"=>"192"}

Downstairs, there‚Äôs a wall of booths, tables set against the staircase and vintage lamps throwing murky light.\n\nThe bar's cocktail menu changes frequently, offering riffs on classics plus more off-beat concoctions.
